👋 Hi there! I'm Mahyar - it's pronounced: /ˈma'h:īär/ 👋

I’m a scientist 👨‍🔬, an engineer 👨‍💻, and a homo sapien 👨

I'm a senior AI/ML scientist. I work at TfNSW on a number of AI-based projects ranging from automatic road condition
monitoring using cameras and different sensors, AI assistant for project management using LLM agents, 
Previously I worked for a biotech company
called <a href="https://provectusalgae.com/">
Provectus Algae Pty Ltd</a>, where I lead the machine learning team. In this company,
we want to accelerate microalgae 🍀 to extract and produce natural biosynthetic molecules 🧬.

I January 2023, I started Entropia, my consultancy company to help other companies with their AI/ML projects.

I'm also an active researcher 📚. I am affiliated with <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/abi.html/">
