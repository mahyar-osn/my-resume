# üëã Hello, World! I'm Mahyar (/Ààma'h:ƒ´√§r/)

### I am passionate about intelligence, both in brains and machines.

I'm fascinated by the two most complex intelligence systems we know: **the human brain** and **artificial intelligence**. This dual passion has shaped my career at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and computer vision.

### What I'm Building Now

As a Senior ML Scientist at <a href="https://www.cotreat.ai/">CoTreat AI</a>, I'm building AI-based computer vision
solutions to transform dental healthcare. We're creating AI systems that can detect, diagnose, and assist in treatment
planning with precision that augments human expertise ü¶∑.

### My AI Journey

My path through AI has been diverse and purpose-driven:
- Leading the ML team at <a href="https://provectusalgae.com/">Provectus Algae</a>, I applied AI to accelerate the
discovery and production of natural biosynthetic molecules from microalgae üçÄüß¨.
- At <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/abi.html/">Auckland Bioengineering Institute</a>, I worked on ground-breaking
projects in the intersection of AI and bioengineering.
- As a ML Scientist at <a href="https://www.soulmachines.com/">Soul Machines</a>, I worked on projects in the realm of digital humans.
- At <a href="https://www.aider.ai/">Aider</a>, I worked on building systems that bridge natural language processing and practical business applications.

### Research & Collaboration

I maintain active research ties with the Auckland Bioengineering Institute üìö, where I explore the frontiers of
computational biology üî¨ and neuroscience üß†. My collaboration with Oxford University's
<a href="https://www.mrcbndu.ox.ac.uk/groups/bogacz-group">Bogacz Group</a> focuses on predictive coding, exploring how 
our brains process information and make predictions.

### Beyond Technology

When I step away from algorithms and neural networks, you might find me on stage üé≠. My passion for acting has led me 
to perform in theatre productions and films across Auckland and Sydney ‚Äì exploring human emotion and storytelling from 
an entirely different perspective. Check out some of my acting work [here](/acting/).
