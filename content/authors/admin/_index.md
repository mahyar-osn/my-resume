I’m a scientist 👨‍🔬, an engineer 👨‍💻, and a homo sapien 👨

I'm a senior AI/ML scientist. I recently joined a biotech company called <a href="https://provectusalgae.com/">
Provectus Algae Pty Ltd</a>, to lead the machine learning team. In this company,
we want to accelerates microalgae 🍀 to extract and produce natural biosynthetic molecules 🧬.

I'm also an active researcher 📚. I am affiliated with <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/abi.html/">
Auckland Bioengineering Institute </a> of the University of Auckland where I undertake
scientific research and act as a consultant on various projects. My research interests include computational biology 🔬,
machine learning 🧮, and neuroscience 🧠.
