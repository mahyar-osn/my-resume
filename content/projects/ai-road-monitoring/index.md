## Project Overview

This project focused on developing an AI-based system for automatically monitoring road conditions using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system was designed to identify and classify various road defects such as cracks, potholes, and other surface irregularities.

### Key Features

- Real-time detection and classification of road defects
- Integration with existing road monitoring systems
- Automated reporting and prioritization of maintenance needs
- Mobile application for field inspections

### Technologies Used

- TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning models
- Computer vision algorithms for image processing
- Cloud-based infrastructure for scalable deployment
- Mobile application development for field use

### Impact

The system significantly improved the efficiency of road maintenance operations by:

1. Reducing manual inspection requirements
2. Providing objective and consistent assessment of road conditions
3. Enabling data-driven decision making for maintenance prioritization
4. Lowering overall maintenance costs through early detection

### Future Developments

Future plans for this project include:
- Integration with drone imagery for wider coverage
- Predictive analytics for maintenance planning
- Integration with smart city infrastructure
